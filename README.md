Really basic application made at the beginning of my coding journey. It has a quite big base of quiz questions. Have few options like a quiz with questions of all categories at all, quiz of one category or questions by question ID.

  ## baza.txt
That file have all quiz questions. In each line there is a ID, correct answer, inside ordered ID (from 1), kategory ID, question content, 4 answers (or 4 times `-` if open question)
